      <h2>Teaching Metaphor</h2>
      <p>Being a teacher is like going snowboarding. It’s a long journey just to get to the top of the mountain. This is like teaching a new lesson and you never know exactly how your students are going to take it. On your way down the hill, you will hit many bumps and probably fall many times. As a teacher, these setbacks will happen, and you have to be that person to pick your students up if they fall and help them gain confidence to continue on the journey down the slope. Even if it is a bumpy ride down the hill, it is still so much to enjoy the ride. Having the wind hit your face as you fly down the mountain is the same type of joy and excitement your students will feel when they master and topic that they struggled with at first. When you go snowboarding, you could be in sunny and blue skies, or you could find yourself caught in a blizzard. In your classroom you will experience days that are sunny and run smoothly. There will also be days where you feel like you’re caught in a blizzard and nothing is going as planned. A successful teacher knows how to handle both situations and make it a fun and successful day no matter the weather. </p>
