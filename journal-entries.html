      <p>In the teaching profession, “goodness of fit” refers to how good a match it is between your personal qualities and the demands of teaching. I often consider the good qualities I have that will help me in teaching. I also understand that I likely will develop better qualities as I gain experience teaching. I need to consider my strengths and use them. I also need to be aware of my weaknesses and work to improve. Some very important qualities of a good teacher is someone who is committed, caring, courageous, conscious, and centered. I think my strengths are that I am caring, conscious, and centered. I am very aware that I am a role model to the students and that my actions make a huge impact on their lives. I think as long as I stay mindful of my actions and feelings, I can stay focused and be a life-long learner. With experience I will gain confidence and strengthen my weaknesses.</p>

      <p>It is so important to create a sense of community in your classroom so that all students feel comfortable at school and have the best environment for learning. If students feel comfortable in class, they will be free to be creative and get excited about learning. Also, there are many students who experience trauma and unhappiness outside of school. School should be the place they come where they feel safe and supported. This relates to classroom management because having a community where there is respect between all students and the teacher, keeps the classroom running efficiently. Students who feel comfortable with their peers and with their teacher will have the freedom to express their feelings and deal with them appropriately</p>

      <h2>Journal 10</h2>
      <p>Teaching is the profession for me because I love working with young people and helping fuel their interest for gaining knowledge. Seeing how excited young students are to learn makes my whole day. I would say that teaching is the most important profession. You have the ability to teach the future generations and make sure that they are set up for success and have the confidence and skill to do big things. As a teacher you have the ability to impact so many lives in the best way. I am so excited to be that person for my students that they trust and that they enjoy learning from. Even more importantly than teaching students’ content, I am excited to help students gain confidence in themselves and allow them to realize that they can do things even if they are hard.</p>
