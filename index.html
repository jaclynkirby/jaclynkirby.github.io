      <p>My name is Jaclyn Kirby and I am a student at Chico State. I am a Liberal Studies major and I look forward to applying to the credential program at Chico State next year. I am from a small town in the Bay Area called Discovery Bay. Growing up I was a competitive gymnast for ten years where I learned that determination and hard work is necessary to accomplish your goals. During high school I was involved in my schoolâ€™s cheer team and in Leadership. I have loved my time at Chico State and during this time I have had the opportunity to volunteer in a first-grade classroom. This experience has made me more excited to continue learning from other teachers and have a class of my own in the future.
