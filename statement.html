      <h2>My Statement</h2>
      <p>I decided I want to be a teacher during my four years as a competitive gymnastics coach. When I started coaching at 16 years old, I had no idea how those children would change my life and inspire me the way that they did. I instantly knew that I loved working with young children. It was incredible to see how they were so excited and eager to learn something new every day. Eventually I began to realize that my gymnasts looked up to me as a role model and they were thrilled to learn what I knew. It wasn’t until a couple years into my coaching career that I realized that this is what I should be doing for the rest of my life. Not coaching gymnastics, but teaching children and inspiring them to be excited about learning new things. Seeing a child struggle and then being there with them every step of the way until they master it is the best feeling. I look forward to working with young students every day and helping them build confidence in their abilities. I hope to continue to teach students to stay curious and never stop being excited to learn new things.

      <p>The most important job a teacher has is to help students learn about themselves as they learn about the world around them. One of my top priorities as a teacher will be to create a sense of community in our classroom. If students feel comfortable and have a feeling of belonging in their class, they will feel freedom to be creative and experience the most successful learning experience. My goal is to show positivity and encouragement, so all my students feel supported at all times. If I am able to build students’ confidence so that they feel certain that they can go on and achieve any goal that they set, I will have done my job.   </p>
