      <h2>My Statement</h2>
      <p>I decided I want to be a teacher during my four years as a competitive gymnastics coach. When I started coaching at 16 years old, I had no idea how those children would change my life and inspire me the way that they did. I instantly knew that I loved working with young children. It was incredible to see how they were so excited and eager to learn something new every day. Eventually I began to realize that my gymnasts looked up to me as a role model and they were thrilled to learn what I knew. It wasn’t until a couple years into my coaching career that I realized that this is what I should be doing for the rest of my life. Not coaching gymnastics, but teaching children and inspiring them to be excited about learning new things. Seeing a child struggle and then being there with them every step of the way until they master it is the best feeling. I look forward to working with young students every day and helping them build confidence in their abilities. I hope to continue to teach students to stay curious and never stop being excited to learn new things.</p>
